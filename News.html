  <h2>Facial Recognition Today</h2>
  <p>First, facial recognition has clear issues in America Today. For example, an MIT study of several gender-recognition systems found they had up to a 34% error rate for dark-skinned women. The error rate was 49 times higher then white men (Ivanova). In addition, a Commerce Department study showed a facial recognition algorithm had significant errors such as identifying different people as the same person. However, the error rates were significantly higher amongst African Americans compared to Eastern Europeans (Ivanova). This bias in facial recognition has already taken a toll on communities of color. In 2016, police surveilence cameras in LA using facial recognition often misidentifed innocent African American individuals as criminals (Garvie). Dispite the pitfalls, facial recognition still goes largely unregulated in America. Kris Hammon, a professor of computer science at Northwestern University, stated, "There's not yet a standard for how you evaluate [facial recognition] and how you consider whether or not the technology makes sense for one application or another." The concerning aspect of facial recognition is it continues to be implimented into areas of America without a significant improvement in this bias.</p>
  <h2>Dangers of Evolving Warfare Technology</h2>
  <p>Warfare technogy is starting to include facial recognition to aid the government in identifing dangerous individuals, for instance. Specifically, the U.S. military is currently developing software used to identify individuals up to a kilometer away (Hambling). However, if facial recognition does not improve for every race and gender, using it in foreign affairs is dangerous. The bias of facial recognition technology could lead to unfair conviction or death for innocent people in ethnic countries or communities. Because the technology works best on the races or genders that test and develop it, using facial recognition on different countries or communities that are in conflict with said country could add a new magnatude of error to the programs, exasterbating tenstions among countries in conflict, and convicting innocent civilians. It is necessary that governments, especially the U.S., take into account the limits of today's technology and choose a path for future wafare that abides by humanitarian law to the highest degree.</p>
